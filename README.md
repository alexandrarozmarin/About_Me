My background, work experience, and narrative 

## My Background in Section 230 Reform
In high school, as a fellow for Girl Security—an organization geared towards empowering women in national security—I wrote a policy proposal confronting the rise of domestic terrorism by addressing social media as a new front of extremism. This helped me deeply analyze the problem of disinformation from a legislative standpoint. The summer after graduating high school, I interned for the House Committee on Homeland Security where I became deeply invested in Section 230 Reform—finding a way to mitigate social media's impact on domestic terrorism through their algorithmic amplification of extremist content. 

## My Transition and Goal for Tech
In college, I started my coursework as an International Relations major hoping to dedicate my career to implementing Section 230 reform legislation and, in general, fighting international terrorism and disinformation from a political science perspective. But, as I took my political science lectures, I found myself unchallenged by the content and craved a more technical understanding of the issues I was trying to solve, which is why I decided to start taking computer science classes in order to better understand the algorithmic structures of social media platforms on a technical level. I hope to one day engineer a new approach to these algorithms that still promote profit for social media companies but also do not further contribute to extremism in America. 

## My Computer Science Journey
Last semester, I took Introduction to Computer Programming, which is a comprehensive introduction to Python. This semester, I am taking Introduction to Computer Science, which is an introduction to Java. I am also a course grader for my previous Python class—offered the job because of my success in the class.
